# Mailspring MCP Server Plugin

A Mailspring plugin that runs an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, giving AI agents access to your email data — threads, messages, contacts, folders, and labels.

Reads are the bulk of it and are strictly read-only. The one exception is `update_draft`, which edits an existing draft in place. Nothing in this server sends mail, creates a draft, or modifies received messages.

The plugin uses Mailspring's own `DatabaseStore` API, making setup easy and seamless.


## Installation

Use this if you want to install the plugin into Mailspring and run it normally.

1. Install dependencies and build the plugin:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

2. Install the built plugin into Mailspring through Mailspring's plugin install flow, or place the built plugin directory in Mailspring's `packages` directory.

3. Restart Mailspring. The MCP server starts automatically on `http://127.0.0.1:2525/mcp`.

## MCP Configuration

Import the configuration using the following JSON snippet, example vscode snippet included in repo:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailspring": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:2525/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

Use this if you are actively working on the plugin code.

1. Install dependencies and build:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Link the repo into Mailspring's `packages` directory so Mailspring loads your working copy:

  ```bash
  ./install.sh
  ```

3. Restart Mailspring.
